## Notes on bash shell scripting

Open a text file and save the file with a `.sh` extension
```sh
filrname.sh
```

Add Shebang/Hash-bang to the script

Shebang is the entry it tells the kernel to use bash as the script not the default script which might not be bash.
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# write some code here
```
